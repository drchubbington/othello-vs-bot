--Othello--
The classic board game Othello, with a bot to play against if you don't have a partner. The project uses the console to display the board and detect input, so you will need access to one in order to run the project. To place a piece, enter the board position by typing in the row (A-H), pressing enter, typing the column (1-8), and pressing enter a second time. Good luck!
